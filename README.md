## A barebones GUI for pokeAPI

This is a simple GUI for the pokeAPI. It allows you to search for a pokemon by name or show a list of all pokemon.

The project is built using React and Next.js with server-side rendering.

## Installation

To install the required packages, run the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

To run a development server, run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Alternatively, you can build the project and run the server with the following commands:

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

The server will be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Missing Features and Future Improvements

- Comparison of two pokemon
